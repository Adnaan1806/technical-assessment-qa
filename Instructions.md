1. **Test Plan**:

   - Write a simple test plan that outlines your approach to testing this application. Your test plan should cover:
     - Test scope
     - Assumptions
     - Functional and non-functional tests (if applicable)
     - Tools and strategies for automated testing

2. **Manual Test Cases**:

   - Write functional test cases to cover the CRUD operations:
