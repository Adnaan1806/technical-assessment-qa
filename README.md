# QA Technical Assessment

Welcome to the QA Take-Home Challenge for **Amplify**! The goal of this project is to evaluate your ability to identify issues in a simple web app, create manual test cases, and implement automated tests where appropriate.

### Application Overview

This web app is a simple item manager where users can:

- Add a new item to a list
- View items in the list
- Edit an existing item
- Delete an item

The application consists of a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.

### Project Structure

The application is divided into two folders:

1. `client/`: The React frontend.
2. `server/`: The Express backend API.

The application is pre-configured, so you can focus on testing. Simply follow the steps below to get started.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amplify-lk/technical-assessment-qa.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

### What You Need to Do

Your task is to:

1. Explore the web application and identify potential issues or bugs.
2. Write manual test cases for the CRUD functionality.
3. Write automated tests using the provided testing framework.

Deliverables:

1. Test Plan: A markdown or Word document outlining your test plan, including assumptions and test coverage.
2. Manual Test Cases: A document listing all test cases (functional, negative, etc.).
3. Automated Tests: End-to-end tests using Cypress or any framework you prefer.
4. Submit your project by pushing your changes to your GitHub fork.

You have 2 days to submit your work.

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your submission!
